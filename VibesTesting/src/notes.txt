accelerometer:
 • ±4/±8/±16/±32 g at 1.6 Hz to 6.7KHz update rate
 • SPI or I2C

accel:
3.3V
Ground
SCL
SDA

running to teensy:
3.3V
Ground
SCL
SDA

current code:
 • written for MPU5060, it works perfectly for MPU. 
 • broke MPU due to excessive vibes, heat and sending 5V instead of 3.3V.
 • Issues with the code are mainly
    • it only records 1 sensor right now
    • it's written for MPU. So we need to adapt this to 3 of the new sensors
    • needs to talk to 3 different sensors
